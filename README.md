The program is a versatile tool for gaining insights into various aspects of a given text, from basic statistics like word and character counts to more advanced features such as identifying frequently used words, extracting dates and email addresses, and performing targeted word searches.
The program requires to specify a txt file as command-line argument, eg test.txt, and it generates an output txt file named, for example, test_info.txt containing some information of the text provided. Additionally, the user can specify a certain word to be found in the text as command-line argument, as:
“-f word” or “--find  word”.
