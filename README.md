#### Description:
Overview:

txtinfo.py is a Python script tailored for in-depth analysis of text files, developed as the final project for the CS50P course. It encapsulates a range of functionalities, meticulously engineered for efficient processing, error handling, and output generation.

Execution:

The script is invoked via the command line: python txtinfo.py your_text_file.txt. Optionally, the -f or --find flag, followed by a specific word, initiates a targeted word search: python txtinfo.py your_text_file.txt -f captivating_word.

Error Handling:

The script performs robust input validation. It checks if the provided file has a '.txt' extension and appropriately handles excess command-line arguments, providing informative prompts.

Output Generation:

Upon execution, txtinfo.py generates an output file named 'your_text_file_info.txt,' summarizing various aspects of the text.

Data Metrics:

Line Count (number_of_lines): Calculated by iterating through lines in the file, incrementing the count for each line, including those ending with '\n'.

Word Count (number_of_words): Derived by splitting the text into words and counting the resulting list's length.

Character Count (number_of_car): Obtained by determining the length of the entire text.

Blank Line Count (blank_lines): Tallied by identifying lines consisting of '\n' or '\n\n'.

Word Frequency Analysis:

The script identifies and tallies words with more than three characters, providing insights into the most frequent words.

Date Extraction:

Leveraging regular expressions (re.findall), the script identifies date patterns (dd-mm-yyyy) within the text. The dateutil.parser library facilitates parsing and reformatting.

Email Address Extraction:

Regular expressions isolate potential email addresses, which are then validated using the email_validator library. Valid addresses are presented in the output.

Word Search:

If the -f flag is used, the script searches for the specified word (find) and reports its occurrences in the text.

Output Structure:

The output file encompasses a comprehensive summary:

Line count.
Word count.
Character count.
Blank line count.
The three most frequent words.
Extracted dates.
Valid email addresses.
Word search results.
Output File Naming:

The output file is named following a structured convention: 'your_text_file_info.txt'.

Acknowledgment:

Upon successful execution, the script provides a confirmation message, reinforcing the creation of the output file.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, txtinfo.py harmonizes technical precision with user-friendly output, providing a holistic tool for text analysis with clear insights into various linguistic aspects of the input text.
